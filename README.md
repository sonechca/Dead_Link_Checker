## Library

- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
  - Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.
  - Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.
  - User can check the response status code
  ```bash
     >>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
     >>> r.status_code
     200
  ```

## Issues

- Colouring in CMD not work #1
- Use the correct python way when checking for empty/non-empty lists #2
- The current version of the tool cannot read the redirect status code(303, 308). The tool is recognizing that redirect is an error exception
- After the install of requests. I think you should include another line reminding the user to also download:
  "Pip3 install colorama"

## Solution

- Adding the colorama library to fix error. I used function that contain gray color code to use for unknown URL. Colorama library does not have gray color
- I fixed the condition code to check links list and dead_links list
- I added the comment of installation
